# Poker App Frontend

React frontend for the multiplayer poker application with real-time WebSocket communication.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Railway Deployment

This frontend is configured for Railway static site deployment, separate from the backend API.

### Environment Variables

Set these in your Railway frontend service:

**Required:**
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` - Backend API URL (e.g., https://your-backend.railway.app/api)
- `REACT_APP_WS_URL` - Backend WebSocket URL (e.g., wss://your-backend.railway.app/ws)

### Deployment Steps

1. Create a new Railway service
2. Connect this repository
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy (Railway will automatically build and serve the React app)

### Build Configuration

The app is configured to build and serve using Railway's static site hosting:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npx serve -s build -l $PORT`

## Features

- **Real-time poker gameplay** with WebSocket connections
- **Table management** - create, join, and leave poker tables
- **Authentication** - JWT-based login/logout
- **Match history** - view past game results
- **Bot players** - configurable AI opponents
- **Game summaries** - detailed game completion reports
- **Responsive design** - works on desktop and mobile

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
